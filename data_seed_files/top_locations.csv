,Cragmont Park,"37.892, -122.2635","This small area is located in Berkeley a little ways from Indian Rock. 
 
This area offers about a dozen climbs (5.6 - 5.11), primarily easier climbs that can be toproped. This would be a great place to bring beginners, as most climbs are not height dependant, and are fairly safe on toprope. The toughest route is sport, with 4 bolts. The routes are primarily shorter slab routes. 
 
There are no access problems, and according to the signs you could actually have a barbeque here and a nice game of basketball on the court located above the climbing area in the main park. 
 
All routes can be walked off.","From other places: Get off I-80 and head east from the Buchanan St / Albany exit. go 3 blocks, and take the soft right onto Marin ave. Follow the road up the hill to the traffic circle. Go around the circle and stay on Marin, which will be the fourth turn.

,Grizzly Peak Boulders,"37.88143, -122.24296","This mostly hidden bouldering area is located about 10 minutes from the Berkeley campus. There aren't too many routes here, nor are there many rocks, though the ones that exist are have excellent variety in difficulty, ranging from V0 to V9 or harder. Rocks range from 8 feet tall to around 20. As some of the poison oak has been peeled back from the landings of many of the rocks, this area has seen additional traffic in recent years. However, you will still probably be alone in the shady trees surrounding most of the rocks here. 
 
You will find interesting traversy problems, in addition to some challenging overhung routes on the large initial main rock. 
 
The rock is a volcanic mix that is signature of bouldering in Berkeley, with similar rock found at Indian Rock. Some of the rock is crumbly, though it has cleaned up for the most part on established routes. 
 
Perhaps these rocks and climbs have names, but I'm not aware of most of them. If you know the names, please let me know, and I'll update any descriptions. 
 
The rocks continue into the trees, and up for a ways, though climbable rocks stop after 40 yards or so.","Exit I-80 on University heading east towards the Berkeley campus.

,Castle Rock Area,"37.23049, -122.09476","Surrounding Castle Rock State Park is one of the larger climbing regions in the area, hosting a variety of sport, trad, bouldering and top rope problems. 
 
The rock is mostly sandstone, making it fairly easy on the hands and dynos quite slap happy. 
 
Access into the main park will cost you a couple of dollars, but that shouldn't deter you. If money is a concern, you can also park outside the main area and walk into the park. 
 
The bouldering at Castle Rock is some of the best in the state. 
 
If you're looking for a place to stay the night, there is a hike in campground 2.8 miles from the parking lot. It's a nice little spot that is rarely busy.

,San Francisco,"37.81843, -122.28806","While not generally thought of as a destination area for rock climbing, the pure number of visitors that head to the bay area for other purposes make this a great location for a quick day on the rock in between other commitments. 
 
You can climb year round in the Bay Area, provided that winter rains haven't pummeled the area too recently. Often, inland areas are extremely hot in the summer, though the coastal areas will stay pleasant. 
 
American Big Wall climbing took its first roots here, with locals practicing their skills on local rocks before heading to Yosemite for its renowned cliffs. Almost every area that has a chimney in Northern California was first climbed by Warren Harding or Forrest Shute, and you will often see a piton stuck in the rock left over from climbers of another age. 
 
Berkeley, Castle Rock and Sonoma will hold your attention for a great day of bouldering.

The park will range from empty on weekdays, to fairly crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 
 
All of the climbing spots are secluded, with very little amounts of shade. 
 
This is not a climbing mecca, so chances are that you'll have the area to yourself. 
 
The rock is metamorphic, and very solid. It is highly unlikely that any hold will break. 
 
In some locations, the rock is sharp, so watch your hands. 
 
This is mainly an easy climbing area, it can be used for low toproping of 5.10 or less, or it could be used for highball bouldering of widely ranging grades.

,Indian Joe Caves,"37.51545, -121.83053","Located south-east of Pleasanton, Sunol Regional Wilderness presently only has developed climbing at Indian Joe Caves, but other opportunities appear to exist as well. There's a pretty wide variety of rock types in the park, but Indian Joe caves is meta basalt. While approaching the area, you can see some rocks on the top of a hill west of the main entrance, this is called flag mountain and appears to have climbing on it, though development has been discouraged because of concerns it would disrupt raptor nesting. There's a $4 entrance fee and the gate gets locked a little after dusk (9 p.m. in August), though camping is permitted in the park. 
 
A pile of meta basalt rocks, Indian Joe caves offers top roping, bouldering and the occasional trad lead on formations reaching up to 40 feet. The holds tend to be either angular or crimpy and the climbing can be anything from slab, cracks, chimney, impressive aretes, or overhung faces. There's also a wide range of existing climbs, 5.3 to 5.12c. There is also the potential for several climbs with difficulties considerably higher.In the summer, Indian Joe Caves get pretty warm and it would be wisest to avoid climbing the routes that get sun, as the black rock absorbes the sun's heat and makes climbing almost unbearable. Fortunately, there's always a handful of climbs that never get sun and therefore are a lot cooler than their brighter counterparts. 
 
Visit the Sunol Regional Wilderness park website for the latest official information on visiting it.","From the 680-580 interchange, take 680 south 8 miles to the highway 84/Calaveras road.

,Mickey's Beach,"37.8886, -122.6327","Mickey's Beach offers some of the toughest sport climbing in the area, along with some interesting bouldering. Almost all climbs are on the beach, and some are tide dependant. The area can be quite windy, making some of the balancy moves more interesting. Climbs offered range from beginning to expert. 
 
The whole area is free. 
 
A brief bit of history tells that the bouldering area west of the main rock was once a part of the hillside, and in a huge storm in 1986 it fell into the surf as one large chunk. Seven days later, the rock split into pieces, directly in front of an unsuspecting picnicing couple. 
 
The main rock also had some storm trouble. In 1993 a huge storm knocked several classic climbs off the main rock and into the ocean, including a classic 5.12 finger crack known as Mickey's crack. A word of caution for people who travel to Mickey's beach, which is that it's a spot frequented by a rather large group of nudists, so if that bothers you, you should probably climb some place else.","From S.F.

Containing mostly easier climbs (5.3 - 5.11b), Mt. Tamalpais is a great place to teach someone how to climb, set up a top rope, or a great place for a first trad lead. 
 
The climbing primarily faces east, and offers incredible views of the rest of the bay area. Because of it's direction, you will find most of the climbing in the shade in the afternoon. If you're going to be there a while, don't forget to head up to the observation tower for an incredible Pacific sunset. 
 
Due to the rugged nature of the rock, it's probably best to either walk off most climbs, or to rappell from the top.

The climbing history is obscure. The easier climbs were probably pioneered by faculty and students of nearby Pacific Union College. The harder climbs were established by the early 1980s by Tony Yaniro (climbed first 5.13 in North America), Mark Spencer (author of ""Southern Yosemite Rock Climbs"") and the late Jim Hanson (rock climbing instructor at PUC), among others.","MOSSY ROCK: Boulder located on property owned by Pacific Union College, currently accessible to the public.

While the Quantity of bouldering isn't great, the QUALITY and 3 minute approach makes this a great stop (if not entire day) for a Sonoma County rampage. 
 
Climbing is varied on solid sandstone: There are excellent routes for beginners with many uncrowded rocks and problems with V0 or simpler climbing on them. Intermediates will find fewer choices. Experts will love the main boulder, which has problems from V0+ to V9. There are also a few top rope (5.11-5.12) options, though most people avoid them due to their proxminity to other climbing in the area, and also to the loose quality of the rock. 
 
All routes walk off the backside of the boulders. 
 
Sand level can play a major factor into the difficulty of the climbing here. Living a Dream (V5) which ascends the right arete of the main rock simply cannot be done as the 5 in the winter. Climbing the HARD ""sit start"" Living La Vida Loca (V8) is the only option, as the step into Living a Dream is well overhead. The other difficulty about sand level is that in the winter most of the soft sand goes away, leaving a rocky often jagged beach for highball landings. There are no access fees.

The Nut Tree Boulders
 
 
This basalt bouldering area sits directly above the suburban mecca known as Vacaville. That said, when it's REALLY REALLY clear out, you'll have an excellent view of the Sierra as you pull your way up excellent holds on overhung basalt. 
 
Sitting just above a Vacaville development, this open space bouldering area has no access fees, no ""real"" parking area, and some really fun bouldering on fairly large rocks from 10 - 20 feet in height, and some problems keep you busy for over 30 feet. 
 
The basalt of the area can be rather loose in spots; when you pull a roof into a somewhat uncleaned topout, expect about 30% of what you grab to be loose. It's basalt though, so it probably won't come out :) 
 
Camping? NO! Hotels? Yes! 
 
This area has been developed over a period of time by a variety of different people. Resultingly, you'll find different cleaning techniques, and different landing options. Some routes have an excellent almost manacured landing, and others have a nice sharp chunk of rock on a steep hillside underneath the crux. Take your pick. 
 
Routes range from really easy to really hard, and everyone will find plenty of rotues to keep themselves entertained on almost 20 different rocks, with development potential for those that are interested. 
 
The Nut Tree Boulders are not somewhere you want to be in the summer. In the fall and spring on hot days, you'll find most routes cooking. Winter and cool days will be excellent, provided it hasn't rained in the last 24 hours.","The Nut Tree Boulders are located in the town of Vacaville off of Highway 80 in Northern California between Sacramento and San Francisco.

The Boxcar boulder is a short boulder (10ft at it's highest) but makes up for it's height in length and hosts one of the longest (about 80ft) and best traverses at the Nut Tree Boulders. The steeper side of the boulders hosts a large number of potential eliminates and classic problems while the longer (less steep) side of the boulders offer great, long traverse problems with a grade range that offers something for just about everyone but the most burly of boulderers.","Follow the directions on the front page for Boxcar Woody Boulders.

Unfortunately it's also one of the most spread out areas requiring some effort when jumping from rock to rock. Not to worry though, as boulders dot the entire trail and hillside all the way from Scotts Rock near the road to the Mother Boulder at the very peak of the tallest hill. 
 
There is something for everyone here from classic V0's to the areas current hardest and most classic problem (Scotts Traverse) coming in at a very stout and sustained V9. Highballs, overhangs, cracks, traverses and pumpy face routes. This area has it all and more than enough climbing to keep you coming back no matter what your abilities.","The area is accessible by approaching from either the Boxcar Woody Boulders or the more popular approach from Hillcrest Cir, from which they get their name.",Hidden Boulder; Mad Cow Boulder; Metal Mania Boulder; Mother Boulder; Saddle Boulders; Scootch Boulder; Scott's Rock
,Woodcrest Boulders,"38.37723, -121.98115","The Woodcrest boulders feature a rather tight concentration of boulders in close proximity to one another and consequently are host to the largest overall number of routes unlike the more spread out nature of the Hillcrest boulders. Coupled with it's high visibility from the road and comparatively short approaches has made the Woodcrest boulders the most popular venue at the Nut Tree Boulders. 
 
The general tight proximity of the boulders make it easy to set up a nice circuit or maximize the number of potential routes you can do if you're on a tight schedule. It's also a great place for those who like to explore a bit as no matter which direction you wander off from the main area, you're almost bound to run into another set of boulders eventually. When bouldering out here remember, there's almost always something else just around the corner.","Follow the directions on the main page for the Woodcrest Boulders.

Be respectful of the home owners when walking behind their houses and keep an eye on your dogs. Walk about 100 yards up the gravel road to another cattle gate. Throw your pad over the gate if you have one and slip through the narrow passage way to the left of the gate instead of climbing over it.

As you head down the obvious trail look for the spurs that cut left into the trees. First you will pass a smaller less steep boulder with a couple of problems. The next boulder you come to is the Heavy Metal Boulder and is quite large, there is a rock shelf below the river side (steeper) of the boulder.

,Salt Point State Park,"38.59406, -123.34449","Salt Point offers incredible, tough climbing at a very beautiful, isolated beach or forest settings north of Jenner. 
 
There are over 20 routes (nearly all sport, along with a 5.7 crack), and over 30 boulder problems as of 3/4/2005, with more being developed. While a good portion of the routes are 5.12 and up, the easier routes are worth the trip (Captain Hook, at 5.10a, is an instant classic). The area is pretty new. 
 
The developed sport climbing at the cove is all located on a crag called Sentinel Rock. This area is sandstone - though a tougher version than that found at other Bay Area sandstone areas. Some parts are a little crumbly, and the holds are occasionally pretty sharp on the hands. 
 
The developed and developing bouldering is all around the park, mostly to the southeast of the parking lot and could eventually yield as many problems as castle rock, though in more secluded settings. Excellent boulders with unique sandstone texture and some shitty landings. 
 
Access to the rock is a non-issue, except in one respect - watch the tides! At high tide or high surf, the Treasure Chest wall will get waves that could soak you and your gear if not drag you out to sea entirely. Watch out for sleeper waves when the belay slab is dry! Avoid high tide there, and use caution to keep you and your pack high and dry.

This is a gorgeous place, and all bay area climbers should make their way out to Goat Rock at least once. The routes are quite varied in difficulty, from 5.2 to V10, as are the styles of climbing. 
 
The rock, as most other bay area locations is a random assortment of beautiful rock, blues, reds, greens, whites and black. There will more information on the geology of the area as time allows. 
 
Climbing is free, as are the waves. 
 
The bouldering routes are all walk offs, and most of the climbing routes you will need to lower off.

Being out in the open, this rock will always be in the sun on one side or the other. It's out in the open, so this is a great place to climb on a sunny day. On a foggy, windy day, there is very little protection from the elements, and this would be a very chilly place to be.

,Twin Coves,"38.45822, -123.1417","Located just North of Jenner, this peninsula area is a gorgeous place to spend a day. This peninsula is also known as The Fortress of Solitude. The climbing in the area is mostly bouldering, though there are also some sport climbs and top rope options. Currently about 15 rocks have been climbed or bouldered. Some rocks could be developed with more bolted routes, and there is evidence that the largest rock once was toproped, but the bolts on top of it are rusty and spinning. 
 
The rock of Twin Coves is primarily schist, though some of the bouldering rocks and caves to the north are hardened sandstone. Few of the routes contain solid rock, however, most of the rock is loose and brittle. 
 
For many years the larger rocks of the area were soled, and only recently has development of the area made climbing the larger rocks safer with the addition of modern bolts. Bouldering in the area offers some interesting eliminates along the beach with soft sand landings, and some highball and traverse problems with mostly bad landings up on the bulge with the sport rock on it. 
 
Walk offs are the best bet on most routes and rocks, though a rappell or lower is needed for the bolted rock. 
 
As with most bay area areas, the place is infested with poison oak. So, beware of it on rocks, paths and any place else you might find yourself. 
 
Some of the bouldering is tide dependant, and climbing the seaside routes in the middle of a large swell is not a good idea. 
 
Camping is not allowed in the area, and you will probably get a ticket for attempting to do so. 
 
Fisherman are prevalent in the area, as are seals, so be respectful and keep a low profile.","Approach time: About 10 minutes. 
 
To reach The Twin Coves, head north on 101 from essentially anywhere in the bay area. Upon reaching the town of Petaluma, take the East Washington exit. Go left and drive west, over the freeway.

Keep on Highway 1, through Bodega Bay, and into Jenner. At the intersection of hwy 116 (same highway as in Petaluma, it just winds a LOT) and Hwy 1, you have 3.2 miles until two unmarked pullouts on your left, where you should park in the second larger pullout. These pullouts are just after a sharp right turn. 
 
From the pullout, walk North along the highway past one gully leading to the ocean, to a second gully which literally comes up to the highway. On the other side of this gully a thin trail will pickup leading you parallel to the highway for about 100 yards. You will come to a junction, where a wider (but still thin) path heads directly for the ocean. Follow this path downhill along the ridge, where the largest rocks of the Twin Coves will become evident. 
 
Walk down to the beach, and either up to the main rocks, or walk Northeast or Southeast along the beach for more bouldering options. The main sport rock is around to the right about 75 yards back from the transition from hillside to bulge.

This is one of the closest bouldering areas to The Bay Area, located just 15 minutes East of Santa Rosa, which is roughly a 50 minute drive from Central Bay locations. I drive like a bat out of hell on the 101, and can get there in 55 minutes, even being nice on Adobe Canyon Road. 
 
There is now a fee to park at the Goodspeed trailhead. 
 
Sugarloaf park is named so because of the packaging that sugar used to be sold in the 1900's looked a lot like the rolling hills found in the park . 
 
Camping is allowed in the park at the designated campground which is easily found just before the day use lot. Top roping the cliff behind the parking lot is also an option. 
 
There is lots of development potential at Sugarloaf, and it is a sight of some recent new problems. Potential first ascentionists should try to keep their routes facing away from established hiking trails so as to not detract from other peoples experiences while in the park.
