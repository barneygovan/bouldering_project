Main Rock,Scary Arete,V3,"This route ascends the scary overhang on the left side of the front (downhill) face on the Main Rock at Grizzly Peak. 
 
The V3 variation is a stand start, heading up to two pockets before getting your hands up over the lip of the scary overhand on the mantle ledge of the Scary Overhang.

Stinkbomb Boulder,Return of Stinkbomb A.K.A. Ejection Seat,V2,"Climb the leftmost arete on the Stinkbomb boulder, with hands and feet on the arete, and feet on the face. Climbing is tough for the first 3-4 moves, and then feet get techincal, but the climbing eases in difficulty. 
 
The route is named as such because it represents the first time that my dog Senior (aka Stinkbomb) has returned to the rock, which was first attacked by drunkenmaster and Brian several weeks ago and that day Senior decided to find a nice piece of human shit to rub his face in. Then after I'd climbed it, Melissa was attempting the second ascent and ejected down the hillside after a hold broke and stopped 3 feet from the road where a road biker was timed so she would've ended up on the road about 5 feet in front of him when he was going about 40 miles an hour. She was saved by a heel hook on a tree limb amongst her backflips as she rolled about 25 feet down. I was climbing Stinkbomb at the time, and all I could see was a splotch of yellow tumbling down the hillside, and could hear a bunch of people saying ""oh shit!""",,"A pad, and at least 3 spotters. Spotters protect not from the ground, but to prevent a tumble through the tree and down the steep embankment."

Indian Rock,Ankle Buster,V0,"As you head down the stairs along the north side of Indian Rock to the Pit, there is a slab on your left.

Indian Rock,The Bubble,V5,"Climb up and right from the flake traverse. You will see asmall hole about 2 feet up from the right side of the flake,and then a large jug looking thing 12 or so feet off theground. Hitting the jug is the crux, but you're still notdone yet! Hold on and find some feet as you use less thanideal holds to pull yourself over the edge. 
 
Be careful if you decide to fall, as the landing area issoft, but sometimes a little small for this climb. Logs,trees, and the first couple of feet of the rock itself areall potential hazards.",,Crashpad and some good balance will suffice.
Indian Rock,Center Overhang (aka Pitfall),V3,"This route ascends the lower overhung roof to the left of the chimney in the main bouldering area. It is located about 15 feet left of the main chimney. Begin the climb by starting up the face just on the left side of the roof, and then pull your way up the main section of the overhang. The top of the rock is off until you get to the basketball- like jug to the middle-right of the roof. 
 
There is a prominent sidepull about 10 feet off the ground, and the crux is getting a hand pulling from this sidepull to the basketball jug on the top. 
 
Be careful not to hit the lower section of the rock if you bail in the crux, as this slabby first five feet twisted my ankle on one attempt of this route.",,"A crashpad is nice, 3 would be great."
Indian Rock,Flake Traverse,V3,"This route ascends the large flake just to the right of the overhung wall (V0). This is located around the corner to the right from the main chimney, near the log benches. 
 
Start on up the lower-right side of the flake, and head up and left until the flake ends. Head left off the flake with a reachy move to a large crimp on the right side of the overhung wall. The crux is moving over to the overhung wall sidepull near the top. 
 
Another variation involves matching the crimp before moving your legs over.",,a crashpad or some buddies. You'll probably find a crashpad already underneath this route.
Indian Rock,Indian Rock Traverse,V5,"Start as low as you can on the main rock, pretty close to where the path forks and goes out of the park, or around the rock. Go uphill, into the pit, and exit to the left of the roof problem. 
 
There are several cruxes, and probably about 1,000 different variations to this route. The toughest section is probably bridging the gap near the cave, and the next 2 or 3 moves. 
 
Height is misleading on this route: Yes, you're only 5 feet off the ground, but the route itself is some 75 or so feet long! Go and go and go. Topping out in the end should neither be scary nor require a crashpad. If you've survived the rest of this route, you should be able to climb the final top out with one hand. Breaks are plentiful on this traverse, there a definitely a few sections where you wish there were a few more. 
 
You can also reverse this route (starting at the bottom of the roof problem, instead of the top) and working downhill. This way's a little tougher, and goes at about V7.",,"None, you never get more than about 4 feet off the ground, except at the finish, and that part's easy."
Indian Rock,Overhung Roof,V0,"Ascending the simplest way up the roof on the right side of the main climbing area to a mantle finish, or a simple traverse to the left once the large holds above the roof are grabbed. There are many popular variations with increasing difficulty, many of which I hope will be added to the site. 
 
Going over the roof is a little scary the first time, especially for a beginner outdoor boulderer. The holds are there, but you must feel around on the many chalked surfaces of this section to find them. 
 
To find this climb go to the main chimney and head right around the corner. Located in front of the large wooden log benches, you will usually find someone or someones working on some variation in this section. Another good landmark is a large diagonal flake located 6 to 9 feet above the ground (and the traverse that goes at V4) which is just to the right of this route.",,A crashpad or some buddies. Often times you'll find people with a crashpad already there.

Indian Rock,Overhung Wall - Right Exit,V0,"This climbs the right side of the overhung wall, starting upthe large outcropping. From the block, use the large flaketo help you up, using decent but not great feet.",,"Crashpad, I guess. Won't help much unless youreally jump out of the crux."
Indian Rock,Six Hold Traverse,V2,"If you can overcome a blanket prejudice against ""manufactured routes"" or if you've ever climbed in a gym, you may find this silly exursion challenging and entertaining. The ""manufactured"" tag comes from the fact that problem involves the stacked stone wall along the pathway just down from the Pit on the north side of Indian Rock. This is clearly an artifically constructed structure, but don't let that stop you. If it's any consolation, I didn't build the wall, nor was I the first climber to play on it. It's been a few years since I last did this problem, so it's quite possible that the whole wall has been overgrown with ivy once again. If so, it may be necessary to do some pruning to rediscover the holds. 
 
The object is to traverse the wall from one end to the other. With the many gaps and fissures between stones, this is a trivial exercise. So we'll add some rules: everything on the wall is on-route for the feet, but you're only allowed to use six (6) handholds. Furthermore, each handhold can only be used by one hand (three for the left, three for the right, no matching allowed). The top of the wall and both ends are off-route for the hands. The start and finish involve stable stances with a leg wrapped around the end of the wall. 
 
When I was introduced to the problem, it was the Eight Hold Traverse. Over time, it became the Six Hold Traverse. Further hold elimination seems unlikely, but consider it a challenge. Beta hints: I faced out at least twice in my sequence, and it may be necessary to release one hold before you can grasp the next. Like all good traverses, once you've mastered it in one direction, reverse it and run laps.",,Pruning shears
Indian Rock,Transportation Crack,,"Climb the WIDE very featured crack just to the right of thewatercourse area. This is also an excellent downclimb forother routes in the overhang area, and the right side of thewatercourse area.

Indian Rock,Watercourse,V1,"Tons of eliminates in the section, this is only the easiest one. To find this climb, go into the main bouldering section on the rock. Wander over to the most set-in section of the rock by the chimney. This climb works the Watercourse area, which is the vertical wall directly right of the chimney. A prominent oval can be seen about 10 feet off the ground on the left section of this rock. 
 
For the simple route, start on the crack system to the right about 10 feet of the chimney. Work your way up a flake - like section to the oval. 
 
Crux is all hands. 
 
To get off the route, you can work your way around to the left, you can continue up to the top of the rock via some simple (5.3 or so) climbing, or you can just jump off.",,A crashpad would be nice.

Mortar Rock,Over the Bulge,V3,"Climb up the bulge 10 feet to the left of the Ramp. Climbing is straightforward, with the crux topping out. 
 
This is really overhung, but so is just about everything else on mortar rock! Moves are reachy, but all the hand holds are excellent. 
 
Serious rating is because of the landing being in the base of a large tree (that's really slippery when wet) and a not so nice rock just beneath it.",,"A crash pad, a few spotters, and awarness that there's a tree and a big rock where you're going to need to bailout."

This route has about five different ways to be done, butbasically you climb up the overhang using pockeys, slopersand crimps to a shitty grip about 9 feet off the ground, andthen reach up and left to a cheesegrater for a hold, andfinish by grabbing onto a large jug over the roof. 
 
This climb has been my nemesis since I've moved here, so Iguess it's time for me to find something harder to work on!",,"A crashpad is nice, but not necessary."
Mortar Rock,Red's Revenge,V2+,"Twentyfive years ago there were two challenging problems up the bulge to the left of the finishing scoop of ""Nat's Traverse"" - ""Pinky Paralysis"" and ""Pinky Direct"". They were named for the effects created by vigorously pinching a fist size chunk of stone pasted under the upper bulge. After a year or two of effort during my undergraduate daze in Berkeley, I mastered these problems, then proceeded to run laps and sandbag my colleagues with them. During one such session, I demonstrated ""Pinky Direct"" for the crew, then stood back and admired the struggle. Taking sympathy on their plight, I then proceeded to demonstrate the easier ""Pinky Paralysis"". With body torqued horizontal, feet level with shoulders, reaching over the top, the famous pinky hold snapped and I rocketed off backwards. With lightning fast, cat-like reflexes I did a quick half spin and landed on hands and knees. Unfortunately, I caught the heel of my hand just long enough to shatter the ends of both bones in my forearm. So much for climbing El Cap over spring break. 
 
Someone collected the chalk-caked hold for a souvenir, for that was all that remained of the ""Pinky"" problems. Many tried the line in the following months, but absent the hold it defeated all comers. Many months later, after recovery and rehab, I received a letter with a mysterious substance from one of my oldest climbing partners. Whatever it was, it made me feel strong and full of confidence. I ran up the hill, and after a brief warmup on Bench Wall I jumped on the bulge. The problem went down with a new sequence like rain falling from the sky. I tried to repeat it and failed. I failed for seven more months before finally recapturing the magic. The resurrected problem was christend ""Red's Revenge"". 
 
Beta: Start under the bulge left of the finishing scoop to ""Nat's Traverse"". Left hand to a sidepull over the bulge. Left foot to a divot on the lip. Gaston the right hand above the left and rock onto the left toe. Left hand to a horizontal edge on the upper bulge. Right hand way up and right to a patch of cheese grater. Match and mantle over the top. 
 
Since this was done before the V-scale, consider the rating a humongous sandbag.",,A fat pad and a better spotter than I had.
Pinnacle Rock,Reachy Face Climb,V3,"Located just to the right of the Offwidth Crack, this challenging face climb requires balance and either a long reach or some burly slapping.

About a 30 foot sling will do the trick.
Pinnacle Rock,Remillard Traverse,V1,"Start where Pinnacle Rock meets Plaque rock and traverse around the arete and all the way to the Off-Width Crack.

Start traversing counterclockwise (the next move should be to a downwards horn underneath an outcropping out the rock. Traverse until you come to a cavity in the rock. This should be at the other side of the outcropping of the rock. Begin ascending. Go above the out cropping where there should be an abundance of nice holds. Harmony bears slightly left here, you're on the route if on your left there is a pretty nice horn and you have to come close to a hand-foot match to get to a pseudo-rail for a foot hold. finally on your right is a really nice bucket at the top of the rock. You'll have to search for this bucket with your hand for a little bit, but once you find it you'll fall in love with it. Mantle and top out. You should be at the highest part of Turtle Rock. Why did I name this Harmony? As soon as you go over the outcropping, there is an intense moment of pure bliss and peace. When I first sent this problem, at this moment, it seemed as though I was no longer a separate entity from the rock, but rather a new part of it. I rarely find this kind of genuine and infinite focus and oneness with anything other than on Harmony.

The Boxcar Woody,Boxcar Traverse,V5+,"Traverse the Boxcar Woody Boulder in a Clockwise direction starting on it's Left (south) side beginning on a perfect, flat two hand rail start. 
 
Warm up on the easy V0 wall and turn the corner to a short slabby wall to warm up the feet. Next, drop down around the corner (watch out for the barbed wire fence) and continue traversing the wall. Staying low for a pumpy sustained V2+ on big loaf pinches and crimps or head up high for a more relaxed and less steep variation. Get a good rest on some nice jugs before turning the corner and fighting your way through the last 12 ft of pumpy, sequential crimps and edges (stay low for the V5 or go high to the rim for a V1 finish) before finally pulling around the last corner and back to the start. 
 
You can customize the traverse to make it as hard or easy as you like but staying low the whole way is the original traverse. 
 
When you get it wired, give yourself a challenge and see how many times you can make it around without falling off.",,Pads
Spotlight Boulder,Sun Spot Traverse,V6+,"Traverse the South wall of the Spotlight boulder from Left to Right ending when rounding the corner. 
 
Begin on a two hand rail at a near sit start and start traversing to the right on slopers and pinches.

Hidden Boulder,Brass Monkey,V2,"Climb the obvious highball arete left of Give Me my Forty Sucka. There is a sit start that adds a few moves but most people start on the obvious jugs. 
Slap your way up the arete to the unnerving topout. Hidden crimps and a bit of moss at the top deteriorate the psyche when scratching your way over the lip of this one. A stack of pads is rarely wavered on this classic highball.",,Pads!!!
Hidden Boulder,Gimme My Forty Sucka,V0,Gimme My Forty Sucka is the obvious crack that ascends the East face of the Hidden Boulder. It follows a slightly diagonal seam that starts about 6 feet off the ground and climbs through good lockers and edges with good feet if you spend the time to look for them. The rock is some of the most solid around so not much to worry about there but it's still a good way to scare yourself.,,"A couple stacked pads and a spotter would be wise... Fortunately the landing is nice and flat, but it can look a long way off from up top. 
 
There's an easy wallk off the back once you're up top."
Hidden Boulder,Natural Disaster,V3,"Starts about 8 feet left of the arete on the Hidden boulder. Natural Disaster used to be a potential natural disaster in the making... the problem is pretty highball, and the crux is mostly figuring out the beta on the upper portion of the climb. However, the topout also used to be quite hollow and loose making for an uncontrollable potential disaster for an unsuspecting patron who just pulled down a little too hard. 
That threat is gone now as the topout has purged itself leaving a large scar in it's wake. Natural Disaster now climbs pretty much strait up and tops out on the very left of this scar. A low start and some decent crimps set you up with questionable feet as you search for the last inconspicuous hold to get you over the top. The crux is definitely at the top still giving homage to the name ""Natural Disaster"".",,A pad or two and a couple of spotters are a good idea for this one... the landing isn't so great and its pretty highball
Mad Cow Boulder,Bovine Face,V0,Bovine Face Starts on the biggest hold near the left arete on the main (north) face of cow rock and goes straight up. The crux is simply moving off the first hold.,,"A pad would be nice, though not really vital. You get about 10 feet off the ground, but the crux is LOW!"

Mad Cow Boulder,Mad Cow Traverse,V2,This route traverses across both the entire North and West faces of the Mad Cow Boulder. Its about 30 feet long and gets pretty pumpy near the arete and rounding the corner. Try and traverse back and forth as many times as possible for a good pump.,,Doesn't get very high off the ground. A spotter or pad would be nice though.
Mad Cow Boulder,Naked Lunch,V3,Sit start slightly right of the middle of Cow rock on a decent rail. Thin edges and slopers bring you up to a big move over the top. This route has a few possible variations depending on how you start it ranging from V3 to V4/5.,,a pad if you like soft landings
Mad Cow Boulder,Naked Lunge,V4,"This route is nearly the same as Naked Lunch but instead of using all holds available, you dyno for the top from a good rail.

Mother Boulder,Motherfucker Traverse,V4-5,"Start on a rock/tree to the left of the low angle decent and traverse the boulder going left. Some sketchy lichen awaits on the south side along the crack, but not to worry, you have to move through there quick anyway or the angry natives will swarm your position. Stay fairly low along the length of the traverse to keep the difficulty up, or climb higher (V1-) for a more casual route with good feet. End back on level ground where the downclimb from the top of the boulder is.",,Boulder pad and a buddy dragging it under you if you actually want a pad.
Saddle Boulders,Biotech,V2-3,"Start under the far right side of the large overhang on the lower (Y Crack) boulder and climb up and left to the blunt arete on many slopers and sidepulls. Once you hit the jug near the bottom of the arete, climb the slightly overhanging jugfest on the arete to the top. 
 
There are many opportunities for eliminates on this face.",,a pad or two and a spotter recommended.
Scootch Boulder,Ashes in the Wake,V7+,"Start on an obvious low two hand match on the far left edge of the boulder. Traverse the entire boulder to the right staying at least 6 inches to a foot below the jugs near the lip of the boulder. This seemingly holdless variation to the traverse requires finding all the small, often sharp or bleak holds and dialing in the sequence before sending this super sustained enduro test piece. A good route to work on when taking a break from working the near by Scotts traverse as it's a short step down in difficulty, but not endruance. Named after a small fire swept through the area a day or two after the FA.",,Round up for the thistle that grows in the late spring.

Scott's Rock,Scott's Traverse,V9,"Traverse the entire boulder starting on a small rounded rock pedestal left of Coulda been Jimi's. Drop down almost immediately and stay fairly low the entire way. Once you reach the crack (you should still be really low to the ground) pull through the semi short but stout crux and reach for some thank god jugs rounding the corner. It's not over yet as now you must drop back down to a series of moves up a right leaning ramp/rail and commit to the final 8 ft of micro crimps and blisteringly thin feet of Smoke Pot Row. A slightly ascending brutally thin and sustained V4 traverse with a rounded desperate slap fest exit on the South (low angle) side of the boulder. Best of luck! 
 
There is a V7 variation that is mostly the same but takes the hardest moves in the Crux out. Follow the same traverse from the start, but at the crack (Jimmi's Butt Crack) climb up and use the rounded rail and better holds above to aid your scamper across the steep face before dropping back down to round the corner. You still gotta finish on Smoke Pot Row V4 though. Don't cheat yourself...",,Pad and ibuprofen
Scott's Rock,Should'a been Jimi's,V4,Starts a few feet to the right of Jimi's Butt Crack. Sit start in a shallow scoop and pull up and slightly left through several crimps pinches and slopers.

The Boulder of Bloody Madness,Stoned Dangler,V5,"A pumpy traverse that starts to the far right side of the Boulder of Bloody Madness on an obvious two handed, chest height rail just around the corner. Drop down and begin a sequential and pumpy traverse which quickly rises up to an obvious rail and your first rest. Now gain access into the long horizontal crack system that splits the boulder and fight the pump all the way across the face until you end up on the large juggy moves on the far left side. 
 
You can give up there or go for the glory by climbing up the juggy overhanging arete above to the top of the boulder for the real finish.",,pads - optional.
Cattle Drive Rock,Cattle Drive,V3,"Cattle Drive traverses the rock starting to the far right on the East side of the rock. Start on a series of sidepulls and jugs and round the corner to the ridiculously slick ramp. Next, low ball traverse across the face on balancy rails and a perplexing series of holds. Top out on the arete for the V1+ version or round the corner on the big rail down low and make your way across the face to the crack and finish on Cow Tipping for the full V3 version. Continuing around the corner to the low angle face instead of topping out on Cow Tipping is the more popular version and is still V3.",,A pad or two may be wise for some as a balancy part sits right over a REALLY sharp rock.
Cattle Drive Rock,Cow Tipping,V1,"Cow Tipping is the easiest route that heads up the overhang on the uphill side of Cattle Drive Rock. Find something to get yourself off the ground (which can be tricky), and move yourself up and over the roof. 
 
Almost everything in and around the roof is loose. Losing a hand while pulling the roof requires some good padding and spotting.

Heavy Metal Boulder,Heavy Metal Traverse,V4,"Start on high shelf on the right side of the boulder and work your way left. From slopers, to crimpers, side clings to technical footwork, this route is a great project for those in the v3-v5 range. 
 
Having 2 pads would be a safe bet, you're feet are under a slight overhang and your back is over another small boulder the whole route until nice juggy finish. Crux is moving from slopey section to final pinch before jug.",,
