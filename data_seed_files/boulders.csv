Offering easier routes in the V0 - V3 range, Little Half Dome offers a warmup for people who don't feel like highballing the bench wall. It is also a great break for people killing themselves working on the many difficult problems on Mortar rock proper.

Berkeley,Indian Rock,"37.89215, -122.27301","Inner city bouldering at its best. This area is located inside the city of Berkeley, and elimination problems are the rule. Indian Rock is a locals' favorite because of its easy approach and accessible setting. It can be busy after 5 and on weekends, but if you've got a couple of hours to spare, it's only a few miles from the Berkeley campus, and set in a nice upscale neighborhood. 
 
Rock is mostly smooth, but there is some sharper stuff on the upper area of the rock. 
 
Super classics include the main traverse, and the watercourse area. 
 
The main area is in the shade most of the time, though the tops of some routes can see some sun. 
 
Indian Rock is primarily a bouldering area, but there are a few routes that you might want a top rope. 
 
Descent off the top of the rock can be easily accomplished by walking off the back of most routes. 
 
An interesting History of this rock will be added at a later point, when I have a little more information on the rock.","From the UC Berkeley campus: 
 
Go North on Shattuck until it bends left and becomes Henry (which will turn into Sutter without you noticing). Follow it until just before the tunnel.

There are a few issues to deal with: the amount of graffiti and broken glass near the bottom along with the presence of stoners.

The boulders are about 20 feet from the water at a modest high-tide, and who knows how far at low tide. The leeward side is very protected from the wind but receives direct sunlight from noon until about 6:00 PM, bring yo' sunscreen. 
 
It's all boulders here, no ropes, no bolts. Just bring your shoes and chalk. 
 
It's a lot of sharp chert (or ""chert rich"" to quote our geophysicist friend...) flakes and wrinkles and it's a ton of fun to climb but it'll chew through your fingers pretty quickly 
 
There are no access fees to get here, but it's a LONG drive from San Francisco if you're heading there in the middle of the day on a Saturday (two hours from Berkeley) Just follow the directions to get to Hidden Cove and you'll get to these lovely ladies. 
 
Access issues here are the tide. If it's high, you're gonna be dealing with spray on the rocks, waves lapping at your feet, etc, etc... Closest places to buy a beer are probably in Sausalito, so bring it with you when you head out.

Castle Rock Area,Goat Rock,"37.2282, -122.1079","Goat Rock is tucked a fair way back from the main Castle Park area, but it's worth the beautiful hike in. 
 
It's a pretty sweet mix of slabs and overhung, cave-like climbs, with lots of pockets all around. 
 
The rock itself is 110 feet high, but the routes run no longer than 80 feet. 
 
From the top you get an even more breathtaking view of the valley. 
 
All the climbs have top-rope bolts except ""Left Side of Great Roof"" which has 3 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor. 
 
The climbs range from 5.4 to 5.12a, with something for everyone. 
 
This rock is great if you have people with varying skill levels in your group. 
 
The top rope bolts are easily accessed, but you should definitely bring long slings to set up your top rope if you want your rope to last on this sandstone. 
 
If you're planning on staying 'til sundown don't forget to bring a headlamp or flashlight... otherwise the hike out gets very tricky. 
 
Classics on Goat Rock include Great Roof (5.10b) and the Left Side (5.12a) for more advanced climbers, and Swiss Cheese (5.4-5.7) for less experienced climbers.","From the main Castle Rock parking lot, take the Saratoga Gap Trail west toward Castle Rock Falls. You will cross Kings Creek, then at the fork in the trail, turn right onto Ridge Trail. If you reach the observation platform for Castle Rock Falls you have gone past the fork. Passing by Last Temptation Cliff and Billy Goat rock on your right, you will come to Goat Rock on the left side.

Woodcrest Boulders,Stonewall Rock,"38.37668, -121.98461","Stonewall rock has consistently the best rock in the Woodcrest section of the Vacaville Boulders. Basalt all the same, the rock is less vertical than most of the other climbing in the area, and is a little more weathers, making the holds more slopey in contrast with the typical jagged jug of the rest of Vacaville. 
 
Named because of the 12"" stone wall that surrounds most of the climbing on the rock, the area inside the stone wall (except for broken glass) is a nice flat place to land. While the stone wall certainly gives a nice place to rest, it is a little too close to the rock sometimes, so having a spotter around is a good idea. 
 
There are also several harder routes in the slot behind the main part of Stonewall Rock, though the slot is narrow enough to break your tailbone if you fall. Stonewall Faces Northeast, leaving at least some of the rock in the shade most of the time. 
 
All routes top out into the loose rock above and walk off to the left edge of the stone wall. If you got pads below, jumping off past the final move of the route will save you the rather lengthy and somewhat precarious downclimb.

SugarSmack Traverse"
Sugarloaf Ridge,Triangle Boulder - Sugarloaf Ridge,"38.4386, -122.52252","This short bouldering rock is only about 7' high. However, the 5-10 routes on the rock are quite varied in difficulty, from V0 to V5, and also a very hard project. The rock on the Triangle Boulder is quite stable, considerably more so than many of the other rocks of the Canyon Trail. 
 
The landings are uncharacteristically flat for the rocks of the area. 
 
The descent off the top of this short boulder is fun and committing. Jump off the top onto the grassy hillside just to the climber's right of the routes. 
 
Traingle Arete (V3) is a fun and pumpy short route.","Approach time: 9 minutes. 
 
To get to this boulder, drive 3.3 miles up Adobe Canyon Road from highway 12 into the Sugarloaf Ridge State Park to a 8-12 car pullout on your left. Park. 
 
Cross the street and head downhill on the Canyon Trail, which will have a small 3' high sign pointing you in the right direction. 
 
Walk downhill on the windy and gently steep trail past the Canyon Trail Boulder, which will be the obvious 12 foot high rock on the left that grows out of the hillside. Continue downhill just past the first drainage break another 200 yards, where you will see a large mossy boulder on your left. Walk towards this boulder and past it heading downhill, and the Sugarsmack Boulder will be the scond boulder that you run into, looking like a cube sitting on a point. 
 
Continue past the Sugarsmack boulder traversing the hillside, and the Triangle boulder sits just above a flat rock about 50 yards down.","Pyramid Power

Indian Rock Side ,Hash Rock,"37.23134, -122.09368","Hash Rock is right in front of the main Indian Rock. Nothing that great on it, but a good warm up for the area.",Following the trail from the parking lot will take you straight to it.,
Indian Rock Side ,Indian Cracks,"37.2302, -122.09347","With a handful of quality moderate boulder problems with great landings, this boulder is deservedly popular. There are a few harder routes (traverses, mainly) which I didn't have time to work on, but which may be worth checking out. 

The obvious ""splitter"" crack on the front face of the boulder is called ""Indian Crack"", V0. 

Routes from left to right, starting with Indian Crack, VO are 

1) Indian Crack, V0 
2) Easy Mantle, V0 (also on the front face) 
3) Honey Dipper, V2 (first route on the right face) 
4) 1 1/4"" Crack, V1 (fifteen feet down from Honey Dipper) 

There is also a V5 traverse starting at route 4 and finishing at route 1. I didn't try it but it looked cool. Reportedly there is a V7 traverse on the backside of the boulder, but it didn't look like much. 

Descend from all problems via a 4th class chimney on the left side. Some has taken the liberty of tick-marking all the useful footholds for this descent, which to me seemed excessive, but to each his own I guess.","Park as for Indian Rock. Go right of the obvious visible boulder and follow a faint trail (parallel to the access trail for Indian Rock, perpendicular to the road) for about 100 feet through the trees. You will soon be greeted by the obvious Indian Crack boulder and its eponymous V0 Indian Crack boulder problem.",
