Black Sand Beach,Hidden Cove,,"Located on the second beach, it is very interesting looking rock with layered, tufa like formations on the Serpentine Strata. Boulders ranging from V0 to V6. Carefull with some of the top outs as they can get very high on loose rock. Drop offs might be a wiser desision on some of these problems.","From the beach turn right and walk until you come up to the cliff and hike over the center gulley. On the second beach, you'll come across Hidden Cove nestled closely to the water on the right.",Bholláin Muire (Mary's Pass)
Castle Rock Loop,Magoos,"37.2283, -122.0957","Bouldering bouldering bouldering. This is what Castle rock is ""famous"" for anyways right? Grab and hang onto as many sandstone holds, slopers, jugs, buckets, and little things as you can! 
 
The Magoos are classic bouldering, offering a variety of problems from 5.1 to Vreally really hard. You will see people working on problems in all ranges as well on a weekend, and you may be the only person there on a weekday. 
 
There are no access issues to climb in Castle Rock, unless you don't like people coming to the area that are not climbers watching you in amazement. 
 
Some routes are in the sun, but most are usually in the shade.","Approach time: 5 - 15 minutes. 
 
From the main Castle Rock parking lot, head up to Castle Rock proper. This involves taking the paths to the left out of the parking lot, which are all marked as going to Castle Rock. 
 
Walk up the path hanging a right (uphill) at the junction with the service road, and just short of Castle Rock itself you will see a group of boulders on your left 50 yards from the rock.","Beak, The; Dog Dish Boulders; Mr Magoo Boulder; Mrs Magoo Boulder"
Mickey's Beach,Stinson Beach,"37.89652, -122.63934","Can be crowded by beach goers, but they will polietly move and watch you crank on the boulders. 
 
The difficulty of climbing depends on tide levels and the shifting of sand. It can be a little on the slick side depending on the fog level along the coast. 
 
The rock quality is superb for the most part. So get your shoes one and get crank'n. 
 
Also the town of Stinson is quite a nice little place to hang out and have a nice meal or just take a picnic lunch with you, but don't forget the bottle of nice wine to brig along for after climbing. Box wine is unacceptable here as you're in wine heaven.",Just north of Mickey's Beach off of Highway 1. Go north on the (1) from the (101). There are signs that lead to Stinson State Beach.

Pacifica Headlands,Mori Point,"37.61425, -122.49603","2 boulders sitting atop a quarry. absolutely fantastic view 
 
not exactly a destination, but you can also hike around and explore Mori Point, within walking distance(even shorter driving distance :D) to san pedro & rock away boulder if you like to walk. 
 
The quarry area is marshland with a trail running through it, into what seems a converted dog paradise complete with a little pond.","set GPS for holmes way in pacifca. park in the lot, head up the trail .

you can hike up through quarry trail , and up a mini canyon to find these on the right side. alternative way is up the side of the hillside on a established trail, which sucks just as much",TW Wall; Warmup Boulder
Goat Rock,Sunset Boulders,"38.42931, -123.11572","This rock is mostly top roping, though at a ""mere"" 30 feet, many people choose to boulder a lot of the routes as well. 
 
Being out in the open, this rock will always be in the sun on one side or the other. It's out in the open, so this is a great place to climb on a sunny day. On a foggy, windy day, there is very little protection from the elements, and this would be a very chilly place to be. 
 
Most routes are probably best lowered off, though brave souls will need to downclimb a 5.2 route to get off of the rock. 
 
Pelican Arete (5.10a) is a must do, and is a pretty tough 5.10a!","Approach time: 5 minutes. 
 
From the turnoff into Gaot Rock State Park, drive ~ 1/4 mile to a large pullout on the left. There are several of these pullouts, and almost all will get you to the rocks. If the road goes up the hill and bends to the right, you've gone a little too far, and should turn around. 
 
From the parking pullout, hike downhill into the meadow, where the rocks are a can't miss.

The Nut Tree Boulders,Boxcar Woody Boulders,"38.38908, -121.98472","The Boxcar Woody boulders are the most easily accessible boulders at the Nut Tree Boulders. With an approach that takes literally 15 seconds, this is a great spot for a hit and go burn or a late in the evening session. There's even a great traverse under the glare of a street light on the Spotlight Boulder allowing for an after hours pull down session should you be so inclined. 
 
The Boxcar boulder is a short boulder (10ft at it's highest) but makes up for it's height in length and hosts one of the longest (about 80ft) and best traverses at the Nut Tree Boulders. The steeper side of the boulders hosts a large number of potential eliminates and classic problems while the longer (less steep) side of the boulders offer great, long traverse problems with a grade range that offers something for just about everyone but the most burly of boulderers.","Follow the directions on the front page for Boxcar Woody Boulders.

The Nut Tree Boulders,Hillcrest Boulders,"38.39386, -121.98525","The Hillcrest boulders are home to some of the largest features and most classic routes at the Nut Tree Boulders. Unfortunately it's also one of the most spread out areas requiring some effort when jumping from rock to rock. Not to worry though, as boulders dot the entire trail and hillside all the way from Scotts Rock near the road to the Mother Boulder at the very peak of the tallest hill. 
 
There is something for everyone here from classic V0's to the areas current hardest and most classic problem (Scotts Traverse) coming in at a very stout and sustained V9. Highballs, overhangs, cracks, traverses and pumpy face routes. This area has it all and more than enough climbing to keep you coming back no matter what your abilities.","The area is accessible by approaching from either the Boxcar Woody Boulders or the more popular approach from Hillcrest Cir, from which they get their name.",Hidden Boulder; Mad Cow Boulder; Metal Mania Boulder; Mother Boulder; Saddle Boulders; Scootch Boulder; Scott's Rock
The Nut Tree Boulders,Woodcrest Boulders,"38.37723, -121.98115","The Woodcrest boulders feature a rather tight concentration of boulders in close proximity to one another and consequently are host to the largest overall number of routes unlike the more spread out nature of the Hillcrest boulders. Coupled with it's high visibility from the road and comparatively short approaches has made the Woodcrest boulders the most popular venue at the Nut Tree Boulders. 
 
The general tight proximity of the boulders make it easy to set up a nice circuit or maximize the number of potential routes you can do if you're on a tight schedule. It's also a great place for those who like to explore a bit as no matter which direction you wander off from the main area, you're almost bound to run into another set of boulders eventually. When bouldering out here remember, there's almost always something else just around the corner.","Follow the directions on the main page for the Woodcrest Boulders. 
 
Park along the street next too (not in front of) the cattle gate and walk up the gravel road behind the houses. Be respectful of the home owners when walking behind their houses and keep an eye on your dogs. Walk about 100 yards up the gravel road to another cattle gate. Throw your pad over the gate if you have one and slip through the narrow passage way to the left of the gate instead of climbing over it. Follow the trail and veer off to the left and right when appropriate. There is good climbing on both sides.","Ants Attack Boulder; Backside Boulder; Beer Boulder; Boulder of Bloody Madness, The; Cattle Drive Rock; Cube, The; Kung Fu boulder; Nature Boulder; Stonewall Rock; Tidbit Boulder; Urban Myth Boulder; Wildside Boulder"
