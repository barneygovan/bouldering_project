Black Sand Beach,Hidden Cove,,"Located on the second beach, it is very interesting looking rock with layered, tufa like formations on the Serpentine Strata. Boulders ranging from V0 to V6. Carefull with some of the top outs as they can get very high on loose rock. Drop offs might be a wiser desision on some of these problems.","From the beach turn right and walk until you come up to the cliff and hike over the center gulley. On the second beach, you'll come across Hidden Cove nestled closely to the water on the right.",Bholl√°in Muire (Mary's Pass)

Mickey's Beach,Stinson Beach,"37.89652, -122.63934","Can be crowded by beach goers, but they will polietly move and watch you crank on the boulders. 
 
The difficulty of climbing depends on tide levels and the shifting of sand. It can be a little on the slick side depending on the fog level along the coast. 
 
The rock quality is superb for the most part. So get your shoes one and get crank'n. 
 
Also the town of Stinson is quite a nice little place to hang out and have a nice meal or just take a picnic lunch with you, but don't forget the bottle of nice wine to brig along for after climbing. Box wine is unacceptable here as you're in wine heaven.",Just north of Mickey's Beach off of Highway 1. Go north on the (1) from the (101). There are signs that lead to Stinson State Beach.
